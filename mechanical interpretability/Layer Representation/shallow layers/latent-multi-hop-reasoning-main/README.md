# latent-multi-hop-reasoning

This repository contains the code and datasets used in the following two papers:

- Sohee Yang, Elena Gribovskaya, Nora Kassner, Mor Geva*, Sebastian Riedel*. [Do Large Language Models Latently Perform Multi-Hop Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16837). In ACL 2024.
- Sohee Yang, Nora Kassner, Elena Gribovskaya, Sebastian Riedel*, Mor Geva*. [Do Large Language Models Perform Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning without Exploiting Shortcuts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16679). arXiv, 2024.

## Installation
```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n reasoning python=3.10
conda activate reasoning

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set HuggingFace token environment variable (required for accessing certain models)
export HF_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

## Datasets

The datasets are under the `datasets` directory.

### TwoHopFact

- Introduced in [Do Large Language Models Latently Perform Multi-Hop Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16837)
- Contains 45,595 pairs of one-hop and two-hop factual prompts of 52 fact composition types with balanced distribution, designed to probe the internal mechanism of latent multi-hop reasoning
- `datasets/TwoHopFact.csv` (91MB)
- TwoHopFact is also available in huggingface datasets as [soheeyang/TwoHopFact](https://huggingface.co/datasets/soheeyang/TwoHopFact).

### SOCRATES (ShOrtCut-fRee lATent rEaSoning)

- Introduced in [Do Large Language Models Perform Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning without Exploiting Shortcuts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16679)
- Contains 7,232 pairs of one-hop and two-hop factual prompts of 17 fact composition types, carefully created to evaluate latent multi-hop reasoning ability of LLMs with accuracy-based metrics while minimizing the risk of shortcuts
- `datasets/SOCRATES_v1.csv` (14MB): A cleaned-up version of the dataset which does not contain grammatical errors.
- `datasets/SOCRATES_v0.csv` (14MB): Used for the experiments in the paper which contains a few grammatical errors.
- SOCRATES v1 is also available in huggingface as [soheeyang/SOCRATES](https://huggingface.co/datasets/soheeyang/SOCRATES).
